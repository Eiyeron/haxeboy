Haxeboy
=======
Gameboy emulator in Haxe as an exercice
---------------------------------------

## Disclaimer

This project is far from being an attempt of making a perfect or the next popular emulator.
This is mostly a project that allows us to have a first experience in making complex emulators.
Haxeboy doesn't work yet, nor we can promise it'll ever work.

## Goals

What we want to do for Haxeboy is :

- Making a Gameboy Emulator that works in Haxe
- Being able to run it on a JS canvas from scratch
- Being able to play at least a small subset of simple public domain games

What we don't want to do (yet or not at all) : 

- Supporting Gameboy Color
- Supporting Super Gameboy
- Supporting Link functionnalities
- Programming a "perfect" emulator
